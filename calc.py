# basic calculator code in python 
first_number = float(input("Enter first number: "))
second_number = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# the code below will add the two numbers
print(first_number + second_number)
# the code below will subtract the two numbers
print(first_number - second_number)
# the code below will multiply the two numbers
print(first_number * second_number)
# the code below will divide the two numbers
print(first_number / second_number)
# the code below will raise first_number to the power of second_number
print(first_number ** second_number)
# the code below will perform floor division
print(first_number // second_number)
# the code below will find the modulus
print(first_number % second_number)
# the code below will perform bitwise AND (only works with integers)
print(int(first_number) & int(second_number))
